Free educational app deployable on several native platforms: `Android` & `iOS` (iPhone, Tablets), `Webapp`, `Linux`, `MacOS`, and `Windows`. The application is an evolving educational game. The goal is to establish native development standards applied to a real world application deployed on production via the `Flutter` framework:
- app technical architecture, solution design and active development
- promote `Flutter` cookbook recipies and `Dart` language best patterns
- responsive layouts, screen design, app theme, typography, dark mode, animations
- device local storage, `shared preferences`, `NoSQL` database like `Sembast`, local SQL db `SQFLite`
- automated unit and behavioral tests, end to end (`e2e`) tests, code coverage report
- evolutive structure of the source code, choice of open source libraries
- integration to `REST` and/or `GraphQL` backend APIs
- dependencies injections pattern (`IoC`) for the whole application
- Flutter package (only `Dart` code)
- Flutter plugin (contains both `Dart` and native code like `Kotlin` `Swift`...)
- implementation of best practices, development guide, code reviews, training sessions

## Completed so far

List of demonstrated elements inside the codebase, divided by categories:

- [Covered subjects by categories](docs/sections/completed-subjects.md)


## Platforms support

The app supports multiple plateforms (more than just `Android` and `iOS`). See the list of supported platforms and how to add another platform

- [Supported platforms & builds](docs/sections/platforms/platforms-builds.md)

## Usefull VSCode & Flutter CLI operations

Running `e2e` tests, re-generate `.g.dart` files, coverages reports and many other commands

- [Usefull VSCode features & command line operations](docs/sections/usefull-commands.md)

## Contributors

We are actually limiting the number of contributors (so dont take that personnaly) since this project:
- has to refine it's roadmap and goals
- we are in the process of adding a lot of assets to improve the onboarding process
- coding conventions have to be defined
- the developer documentation will be re-structured soon
