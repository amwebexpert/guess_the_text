## Usefull VSCode commands

    Command-Shift-P > Dart: Open DevTools Network Page
    Command-Shift-P > Dart: Restart Analysis Server

## Usefull CLI operations

### environment info listing

    echo $FLUTTER_HOME/bin/cache/artifacts
    ll $FLUTTER_HOME/bin/cache/artifacts
    rm -rf $FLUTTER_HOME/bin/cache/artifacts
    flutter doctor -v
    which flutter

### clean and rebuild

    flutter clean
    flutter pub get
    flutter run

### unit tests, widget and integration tests, e2e

    flutter test -r expanded
    flutter test -r expanded test/features/game/letter.widget_test.dart
    flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart
    flutter test integration_test

Steps to see test coverage of the project:

    # Generate code coverage (will be located at 'coverage/lcov.info')
    flutter test --coverage

    # Generate html for test coverage
    # You will need to have lcov installed (`sudo apt install lcov`, `brew install lcov`)
    genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html

    # Open the html that's generated
    open coverage/html/index.html

If you want to see test coverage in vscode, take a look at following extensions that can help you out:
- [Flutter Coverage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Flutterando.flutter-coverage) : Calculates test coverage for flutter
- [Coverage Gutters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters) : Shows you covered and uncovered lines

### Start headless android emulator before running e2e tests

    emulator -list-avds
    emulator -avd  Pixel_5_API_29 -no-audio -no-window

- https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests
- [e2e demo recording here](training/recordings/e2e-tests-demo-flutter.mov)


### Kill android emulator

    adb kill-server
    adb emu kill
    
If that's not enough, from Android Studio on the AVD panel, go to the down arrow and click on the "Show on Disk". You will get the list of all files, then remove the files "*.lock"

### Mockito re-generate `.g.dart` mocks files

    flutter pub run build_runner build
    flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

- https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/unit/mocking


### MobX re-generate `.g.dart` store files

    flutter packages pub run build_runner build

## Start Flutter app on Simulator or a specific device

    open -a Simulator
    xcrun simctl list
    flutter devices
    flutter run -d "iPhone 13"
    flutter run -d "SM A505W"
